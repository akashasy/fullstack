  Courses that introduce you to essential components of taking on end to end development can help you build critical skills you need. If you're already familiar with one aspect of development, courses that teach you the other component help you build your resume and pad your abilities. Many companies are looking for that one person who can take on the entire production lifecycle, so make sure you've got everything you need to become a full stack developer.
  Full stack web developers have the ability to design complete web application and websites. They work on the frontend, backend, database and debugging of web application or websites.
